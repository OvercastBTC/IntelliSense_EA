Global-intellisense-everywhere in the following Gi.

Gi is a search suggest drop-down action list, a query feature used to show shortcuts for actions (numbers 0-9), while the query is typed. Gi has no own GUI, but runs parallel to every other GUI (there are exceptions).

Before the query is complete, a drop-down list with the suggested actions appears to provide options to select. 

Gi behaves window specific, different in each window. The actions can be reused and inherited.

The data is read from files into a sqlite database. The names for the files are assigned automatically (default, there are exceptions).

In contrast to search suggestions, as they are known by search engines, with GI can be offered not only text completions, but actions. text completions is a subset of acions. Actions are typically small programming modules, but can also be large, permanent programs. There are no limits to the Imagination.

The Drop-down list is located near the Mouse, when it was not moved with the Mouse. Theire size can also be changed. Please refer to the documentation for further Details.
